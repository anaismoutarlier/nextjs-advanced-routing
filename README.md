# Nextjs - Advanced Routing

This is Nextjs demo app using App Router, dynamic routes, an example API route, and server components.

_Note: This project uses a free external API which may take some time to start working upon the first request._

To get started,
first create a `.env.local` file with the following content:

```
POSTS_API_KEY="YAARHQSIVSZRRAZW5LA7KTELVGOZQ5YI6P9"
POSTS_TOKEN="ABCD1234EDFG"
```

Then, start the development server from the terminal with one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
